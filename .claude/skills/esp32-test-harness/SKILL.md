# ESP32 Test Harness

How to manipulate the ESP32-C3 DUT during automated tests using the Serial Portal (workbench.local) and WiFi Tester infrastructure.

**Golden rule:** The Serial Portal and MQTT broker are always-on infrastructure. Tests NEVER start, stop, or restart them.

**Driver rule:** Always use `WorkbenchDriver` from Python — never raw curl. This gives typed responses, proper error handling, and access to the slot `state` field.

---

## Test Execution Protocol

Every test case follows a strict 3-phase execution cycle. The Pi's test progress panel shows the current phase so the operator can follow along.

### The 3 Phases

| Phase | Panel Shows | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Preconditions** | `[TC-100] Preconditions: checking DUT reachable...` | Verify or establish each precondition from the test spec. If a precondition fails, try to establish it (e.g. start AP, wait for connection). If unrecoverable, FAIL the test. |
| **Execute** | `[TC-100] Step 2: Publish 3500 to wallbox topic` | Run each step from the test spec's step table, one by one. Check the expected result after each step. |
| **Result** | `TC-100: PASS` or `TC-100: FAIL - wallbox_power was 0` | Record PASS/FAIL/SKIP with details. |

### Panel API Calls

```python
# 1. Start a test session (once, at beginning of phase)
wt.test_start(spec="modbus-proxy-test-spec v4.1", phase="Phase 1: Functional Tests", total=76)

# 2. For each test case — 3 phases:

# Phase: Preconditions
wt.test_step("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "Preconditions: checking slot idle...")
# ... verify/establish preconditions ...
wt.test_step("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "Preconditions: verifying DUT reachable...")

# Phase: Execute
wt.test_step("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "Step 1: Power on ESP32-C3")
# ... perform step 1, check expected result ...
wt.test_step("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "Step 2: Observe serial log")
# ... perform step 2, check expected result ...

# Phase: Result
wt.test_result("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "PASS")
# or
wt.test_result("TC-100", "Basic Startup", "FAIL", "mqtt_connected was false after 15s")

# 3. End the session (once, at end of phase)
wt.test_end()
```

### Execution Rules

1. **Follow the test spec literally.** The test spec document is the script. Execute the preconditions, steps, and pass criteria exactly as written.
2. **One step at a time.** Update the panel before performing each action. The operator should see what's happening in real time.
3. **Preconditions are active.** Don't just check — establish. If the AP isn't running, start it. If NVS needs erasing, erase it. Only fail if the precondition is truly unrecoverable.
4. **Record baselines.** When the test spec says "record X as `Y_before`", capture the value and compare in the result phase.
5. **Never skip the panel update.** Every phase transition and every step must be visible on the panel.
6. **Produce a results document.** After running tests, write results to a markdown file with: test ID, name, result (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), details, and timestamps.
7. **Random test credentials for artificial networks.** When provisioning the DUT onto an isolated test AP, generate a random SSID/password per run. This proves the DUT used the provisioned credentials, not a cached network.
8. **All tests run on the artificial network.** Phase 1 covers all functional tests on the WiFi Tester's artificial network (no dependency on `private-2G` or home infrastructure). Phase 2 is reserved for long-duration / soak tests.

## Infrastructure

| Component | Address | Role |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Serial Portal | workbench.local:8080 | RFC2217 serial proxy, WiFi/Serial API |
| DUT WiFi (test AP) | 192.168.4.x | DUT on WiFi Tester AP |
| DUT WiFi (portal) | 192.168.4.1 | DUT in captive portal AP mode |
| MQTT broker | 192.168.4.1:1883 | Mosquitto on Pi (via WiFi Tester AP) |

Slots are mapped to physical USB hub ports via prefix matching. The portal auto-detects the slot count from the Pi's USB topology at startup (typically 3–4); `workbench.json` is optional and only needed for custom labels/ports. Slot labels are `SLOT1`, `SLOT2`, ..., `SLOTn`; TCP ports are `4000 + slot_index` (e.g. SLOT1 = :4001). **Always discover the DUT slot at runtime** using `wt.get_devices()` -- never hard-code a label or port.

### MQTT Broker (mosquitto on Pi)

The Pi at workbench.local runs a mosquitto MQTT broker. When the WiFi Tester AP is active, the broker is reachable by DUTs on the artificial network at **192.168.4.1:1883**.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Host (from DUT on AP) | 192.168.4.1 |
| Host (from home network) | workbench.local |
| Port | 1883 |
| Username | admin |
| Password | admin |

**Service management (from dev machine):**
```bash
# Check status
ssh pi@workbench.local sudo systemctl status mosquitto

# Restart
ssh pi@workbench.local sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

**Quick tests (from dev machine on home network, or any host that can reach the AP):**
```bash
# Publish a test message
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.4.1 -u admin -P admin -t test -m "hello"

# Subscribe to all topics (verbose)
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.4.1 -u admin -P admin -t "#" -v
```

**Configuring the DUT to use the Pi broker:**

After WiFi provisioning (DUT connected to the WiFi Tester AP), send a `set_mqtt` command via MQTT to point the DUT at the Pi broker. This eliminates any dependency on home-network infrastructure.

```python
# Example: after DUT connects to test AP, configure its MQTT target
resp = wt.http_post(f"http://{dut_ip}/api/mqtt",
                     json_data={"host": "192.168.4.1", "port": 1883,
                                "user": "admin", "password": "admin"})
```

All functional tests (Phase 1) run entirely on the artificial network — the WiFi Tester AP plus the Pi's mosquitto broker. There is no dependency on `private-2G` or any home-network MQTT broker.

## 0. WiFi Tester Driver Setup

All test operations use `WorkbenchDriver`. Set `PYTHONPATH` to import it:

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/tmp/Universal-Embedded-Workbench/pytest")
from workbench_driver import WorkbenchDriver

wt = WorkbenchDriver("http://workbench.local:8080")
```

Or from bash one-liners:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/Universal-Embedded-Workbench/pytest python3 -c "
from workbench_driver import WorkbenchDriver
wt = WorkbenchDriver('http://workbench.local:8080')
# ... operations ...
"
```

### Discover DUT Slot

```python
# Find which slot has a device present
devices = wt.get_devices()
dut = next(s for s in devices if s["present"])
SLOT = dut["label"]       # e.g. "SLOT1", "SLOT2", "SLOT3" (fixed labels)
PORT = dut["url"]         # e.g. "rfc2217://workbench.local:4001" (auto-assigned port)
```

### Driver Methods Reference

For the complete method reference (slot state, serial, WiFi, HTTP relay, GPIO, human interaction, activity log, test progress panel), read `references/driver-methods.md`.

---

## 1. Slot States

Each slot has an explicit `state` field visible in `get_slot()` and `get_devices()`:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `absent` | No device plugged into this USB slot |
| `idle` | Device present, proxy not running (available for operations) |
| `resetting` | Serial reset or enter-portal in progress |
| `monitoring` | Serial monitor capturing output |
| `flapping` | Device hotplug flapping detected |

### Check state

```python
slot = wt.get_slot(SLOT)
print(f"State: {slot['state']}, Present: {slot['present']}")
```

### Wait for state transition

```python
# Wait for reset to complete
wt.wait_for_state(SLOT, "idle", timeout=30)
```

---

## 2. Serial Operations

### 2.1 Reset DUT (normal boot)

**IMPORTANT:** If a Pi GPIO is wired to a DUT boot-mode pin (e.g. portal button), ensure it is in `"z"` state (input with pull-up) before resetting. This prevents the pin from floating LOW during the DTR/RTS reset pulse.

```python
wt.gpio_set(PI_PIN, "z")             # Input with pull-up — prevents float during reset
result = wt.serial_reset(SLOT)
print(result["output"])
```

The reset API stops the proxy, opens direct serial, sends DTR/RTS reset pulse, captures boot output, then restarts the proxy. Slot state goes `idle` → `resetting` → `idle`.

**JTAG reset (when debugging is active):**
When the workbench has an active OpenOCD session for the slot (auto-started for native USB chips), `serial_reset()` automatically uses JTAG reset instead of DTR/RTS. This avoids USB re-enumeration and flapping. No code changes needed — the API auto-selects the best method.

### 2.2 Monitor serial output

```python
# Read for 5s, no pattern matching
result = wt.serial_monitor(SLOT, timeout=5)
print(result["output"])

# Wait for specific pattern (returns immediately on match)
result = wt.serial_monitor(SLOT, pattern="WiFi connected", timeout=30)
if result["matched"]:
    print(f"Found: {result['line']}")
```

### 2.3 Flash via RFC2217

Flashing uses esptool from the host through the RFC2217 proxy. Binaries
stay on the host — no SCP needed. Use `--after no-reset`, then reboot
via the API.

```python
import subprocess

# Stop debug if active (native USB shares serial + JTAG)
wt.debug_stop(slot=SLOT)

# Get RFC2217 URL
dev = wt.get_slot(SLOT)
url = dev["url"]

# Flash via esptool (runs on host, sends data through proxy)
subprocess.run([
    "python3", "-m", "esptool", "--chip", "esp32c3",
    "--port", url, "--before", "default-reset", "--after", "no-reset",
    "write-flash", "--flash-mode", "dio", "--flash-size", "4MB",
    "0x0000", "bootloader.bin", "0x8000", "partition-table.bin",
    "0x10000", "firmware.bin",
], check=True, timeout=60)

# Reboot device and restart debug
wt.serial_reset(SLOT)
wt.debug_start(slot=SLOT)
```

**Bootloader offsets:** ESP32 classic → `0x1000`, all newer chips (C3/S3/C6/H2) → `0x0000`.

---

## 3. NVS Erase (Clean State)

```bash
# Via portal serial reset endpoint (stops proxy, opens device directly)
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/serial/reset \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"slot":"SLOT1"}'
```

After erase, the DUT resets and boots with:
- WiFi: `private-2G` (from credentials.h) — **only for initial setup, not for tests**
- MQTT: compiled default (see config.h) — reconfigure after WiFi provisioning via MQTT `set_mqtt` command to point at 192.168.4.1
- Boot count: 0
- Debug mode: off

---

## 4. Captive Portal

### 4.1 Trigger captive portal (GPIO — fully automated)

If the Pi has a GPIO wired to the DUT's portal button pin, driving it low during boot triggers captive portal mode — no human, no rapid resets.

**Look up from project FSD/config:** which Pi GPIO pin is wired to which DUT pin, the active level (usually LOW), and the serial output marker that confirms portal mode.

**IMPORTANT:** Always release GPIO back to input (`"z"`) when done. The `ok: true` response from `gpio_set` confirms the pin state — do not poll `gpio_get()` to verify.

```python
# Pin numbers from project FSD — example only, look these up per project
PI_PIN = 17        # Pi BCM pin wired to DUT portal button
PORTAL_MARKER = "CAPTIVE PORTAL MODE TRIGGERED"  # serial output to expect

try:
    wt.gpio_set(PI_PIN, 0)                # Hold DUT portal pin low
    result = wt.serial_reset(SLOT)         # Reset DUT — boots into portal
    assert any(PORTAL_MARKER in line for line in result["output"])
finally:
    wt.gpio_set(PI_PIN, "z")              # Input with pull-up — DUT pin returns to idle
```

**Fallback A** — human operator (if GPIO wiring unavailable):
```python
import threading
human = threading.Thread(target=wt.human_interaction,
    args=("Hold portal button on DUT, then click Done",),
    kwargs={"timeout": 60})
human.start()
wt.serial_reset(SLOT)
result = wt.serial_monitor(SLOT, pattern=PORTAL_MARKER, timeout=15)
assert result["matched"]
human.join()
```

**Fallback B** — rapid resets (firmware with boot-counter portal trigger):
```python
result = wt.enter_portal(SLOT, resets=3)
wt.wait_for_state(SLOT, "idle", timeout=30)
```

### 4.2 Interact with captive portal (via WiFi Tester)

```python
# Join the portal AP
wt.sta_join("MODBUS-Proxy-Setup", "", timeout=15)

# Access portal page
resp = wt.http_get("http://192.168.4.1/")
print(f"Status: {resp.status_code}, Body: {resp.text[:200]}")

# Scan for networks from portal
resp = wt.http_get("http://192.168.4.1/api/scan")
print(resp.json())

# Submit WiFi credentials through portal
resp = wt.http_post("http://192.168.4.1/api/wifi",
                     json_data={"ssid": "TestAP-Modbus", "password": "test12345"})
print(resp.json())

# Leave portal AP
wt.sta_leave()
```

### 4.3 Restore DUT from portal mode

**Option A** — Submit WiFi credentials via portal (see 4.2).

**Option B** — Erase NVS via serial reset and reflash (use `/api/flash`).

**Option C** — Wait for portal timeout (5 minutes), DUT reboots automatically.

---

## 5. WiFi AP Management

### 5.1 Start test AP

```python
result = wt.ap_start("TestAP-Modbus", "test12345")
print(f"AP IP: {result['ip']}")
```

### 5.2 Check AP status and connected stations

```python
status = wt.ap_status()
print(f"Active: {status['active']}, SSID: {status['ssid']}")
for sta in status.get("stations", []):
    print(f"  Station: {sta['mac']} @ {sta['ip']}")
```

### 5.3 Stop test AP

```python
wt.ap_stop()
```

### 5.4 Wait for DUT to connect to test AP

```python
# Start AP then wait for DUT station event
wt.ap_start("TestAP-Modbus", "test12345")
evt = wt.wait_for_station(timeout=30)
print(f"DUT connected: {evt}")
```

### 5.5 HTTP relay to DUT on test AP

When DUT is on the WiFi Tester's AP (192.168.4.x), use relay:

```python
# GET
resp = wt.http_get("http://192.168.4.6/api/status")
status = resp.json()
print(f"FW: {status['fw_version']}, Heap: {status['free_heap']}")

# POST
resp = wt.http_post("http://192.168.4.6/api/debug",
                     json_data={"enabled": True})
```

---

## 6. Common Test Workflows

For complete workflow examples (clean slate, captive portal test cycle, WiFi disconnect test, reset and verify), read `references/common-workflows.md`.

---

## 7. State Detection (Serial Lifeline)

**Serial is the lifeline.** Never rely on WiFi/HTTP to check if the C3 is running -- WiFi may not be up. For state detection examples, the serial output state table, and direct pyserial fallback, read `references/state-detection.md`.

---

## 8. GPIO Control

The Serial Portal can drive Pi GPIO pins to control DUT hardware signals (e.g. hold a pin low during boot to trigger a specific mode). GPIO wiring varies per project.

**Before using GPIO:** Read the project's FSD and hardware docs to find:
1. Which Pi BCM pin is wired to which DUT pin
2. The active level (LOW or HIGH) and the DUT's pull-up/pull-down configuration
3. When the DUT samples the pin (boot only? continuous?)
4. The serial output marker that confirms the expected behavior

### 8.1 Pin allowlist

Only these Pi BCM pins can be controlled via the API:
```
{5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26}
```

### 8.2 API

```python
wt.gpio_set(pin, 0)       # Drive low
wt.gpio_set(pin, 1)       # Drive high
wt.gpio_set(pin, "z")     # Switch to input with pull-up
wt.gpio_get()              # Read active pin states (driven pins only)
```

- `ok: true` confirms the operation — do not poll `gpio_get()` to verify.
- Pins released with `"z"` disappear from `gpio_get()` response.

### 8.3 Rules

1. **Release to input when done.** Call `gpio_set(pin, "z")` when the test session is finished.
2. **Use try/finally.** Ensure release even on test failure.
3. **No redundant verification.** Trust the `ok: true` response. Do not read back the pin state after setting it.

### 8.4 Patterns

**Hold during reset (e.g. force a boot mode):**
```python
try:
    wt.gpio_set(pin, 0)               # Hold DUT pin in active state
    result = wt.serial_reset(SLOT)     # Reset DUT — boots with pin held
    # Check result["output"] for expected serial marker
finally:
    wt.gpio_set(pin, "z")             # Input with pull-up when done
```

**Pulse (toggle briefly):**
```python
import time
try:
    wt.gpio_set(pin, 0)
    time.sleep(0.1)
finally:
    wt.gpio_set(pin, "z")
```
