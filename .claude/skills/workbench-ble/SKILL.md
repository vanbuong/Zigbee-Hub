name: workbench-ble
description: Use this skill whenever the user needs to interact with BLE peripherals through the workbench — scanning for devices, connecting by address, writing to GATT characteristics, or checking connection status. The Pi acts as a BLE-to-HTTP bridge using bleak. Also use when sending keystrokes to BLE HID devices, triggering OTA via BLE commands, or debugging BLE connectivity. Triggers on "BLE", "bluetooth", "GATT", "NUS", "Nordic UART", "BLE scan", "BLE write", "BLE connect".

# ESP32 Bluetooth LE Proxy

Base URL: `http://workbench.local:8080`

## Step 0: Discover Workbench

Before using any workbench API, ensure `workbench.local` resolves:

```bash
curl -s http://workbench.local:8080/api/info
```

If that fails, run the discovery script from the workbench repo:

```bash
sudo python3 .claude/skills/esp-idf-handling/discover-workbench.py --hosts
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/ble/scan` | Scan for BLE devices (optional name filter) |
| POST | `/api/ble/connect` | Connect to a device by MAC address |
| POST | `/api/ble/write` | Write hex data to a GATT characteristic |
| POST | `/api/ble/disconnect` | Disconnect current device |
| GET | `/api/ble/status` | Connection state and device info |

One BLE connection at a time.

## Examples

```bash
# Scan for BLE devices (5s timeout)
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/scan \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"timeout": 5}'

# Scan with name filter
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/scan \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"timeout": 5, "name_filter": "iOS-Keyboard"}'

# Connect by MAC address
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/connect \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"address": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"}'

# Write hex data to a GATT characteristic
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/write \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"characteristic": "6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e", "data": "48656c6c6f", "response": true}'

# Check connection status
curl http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/status

# Disconnect
curl -X POST http://workbench.local:8080/api/ble/disconnect
```

## Nordic UART Service (NUS) UUIDs

| UUID | Role |
|------|------|
| `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | NUS Service |
| `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | RX Characteristic (write to this) |
| `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` | TX Characteristic (notifications from device) |

## Common Workflows

1. **Send a command via NUS:**
   - `POST /api/ble/scan` with `name_filter` to find device
   - `POST /api/ble/connect` with the MAC address from scan results
   - `POST /api/ble/write` with NUS RX UUID and hex-encoded command
   - `POST /api/ble/disconnect` when done

2. **Check if device is advertising:**
   - `POST /api/ble/scan` with short timeout and name filter
   - Check `devices` array in response

3. **Send binary command protocol:**
   - Connect to device
   - Encode command bytes as hex (e.g., `0x02` + "Hello" = `0248656c6c6f`)
   - Write to NUS RX characteristic
   - Monitor device response via serial or UDP logs (see workbench-logging)

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "BLE not available" | `bleak` not installed on workbench Pi |
| Scan returns empty | Increase timeout; check device is advertising |
| Connect fails (409) | Already connected — disconnect first |
| Write fails "invalid hex data" | Data must be hex string (e.g., `"48656c6c6f"` for "Hello") |
| Device not found by name | Check exact advertised name; BLE names are case-sensitive |
